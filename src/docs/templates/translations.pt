            <strong>FIRS 5 does not support translations.</strong>
        </div>
        <p>
            Translations were included in some older versions of FIRS.
        </p>
        <p>
            However the work became too much, and for the health of the FIRS project, translations had to be dropped.
        <p>
        </p>
            Thanks go to those who did diligently contribute translations over many years of FIRS.
