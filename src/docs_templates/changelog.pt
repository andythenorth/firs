    - removed Bauxite and Vehicles chains
    - added Alcohol, Copper and Fish chains
- 'In a Hot Country'
    - replaces 'Heart of Darkness' economy
    - inspired by central-western Africa

    - multiple new chains and cargo types, including Cassava, Edible Oil, Nuts, Phosphate and Manganese
- 'Extreme' economy
    - renamed 'FIRS' to 'Extreme'
    - added Power Plant
    - tip: try 'Extreme' with the Busy Bee Game Script which provides cargo delivery goals

*Improved Industries*

- new industry types:
    - Copper Refinery
    - Liquids Terminal
    - Manganese Mine
    - Phosphate Mine
    - Power Plant
    - Pyrite Mine
    - Pyrite Smelter

- Furniture Factory: 'crates' not 't' in extra text string for
- Grain Mill:
    - renamed to Flour Mill
    - windmill version has improved graphics and layout
- Hotels: now build near any houses, rather than being restricted to 'near town sign', which could limit hotel construction in larger cities
- Lumber Yard: kiln building was broken when built on slopes
- Nitrate Mine: fixed station name
- Oil Refinery: no longer uses graphics from base set, and has additional layouts
- Quarry and Clay Pit:
    - improved graphics, including animation

*Improved Cargos*

- new cargo types
    - Cassava
    - Copper
    - Edible Oil
    - Maize
    - Manganese
    - Nuts
    - Phosphate
    - Pyrite Ore
    - Vehicles
- Engineering Supplies: new cargo icon
- Petrol: now named Petroleum Fuels, better reflects actual use in-game
- Recyclables: removed covered class, added bulk class
- Sugar Beet and Sugarcane:
    - removed the daft magic where Sugarcane was only in Tropic climate, and otherwise Sugarbeet was used
    - these two cargos are now completely independent from each other, don't change per climate
    - Sugar Beet appears in some economies, Sugarcane in others


*General Improvements*

- adjusted clustering behaviour for most primary industries
    - clusters are less dense, making it much easier to place stations
    - especially easier for placing supply delivery stations that should not overlap multiple industries
- adjusted industry production rates for most primary industries
    - production is generally adjusted upwards, especially for farms
    - revised production allows pickup of sensible amounts from a single industry instead of needing to aggregate several industries
    - amount of supplies required now same for farms and mines
- industry probability revised to better distribute numbers of each industry type
- processing industries that combine cargo now have a three-month delivery window instead of one month for increased output
    - this supports a wider range of transport types and play-styles, for example infrequent deliveries with ships
- added missing boost behaviour at some processing industries
- for many industries, allow location on a wider range of slopes, for better distribution on map gen
    - instead of simply disallowing all slopes, require 'effectively level' land, where only the highest corner of each tile must match the highest corner of the industry north tile
    - the benefit of this is that industries are no longer mostly crowded into flat valleys by map generator
- removed gaps in layouts from multiple industries, they look unsightly and aren't actually useful for building routes/stations
- explicitly preserve cargo slots (IDs) for passengers, mail, goods and food, default OTTD houses need them
- removed custom station rating parameter
- added parameters for adjusting 'Enhanced' and 'Gung-Ho' production behaviour at primary industries
    - amount of supplies required for each level can be set
    - increased production at each level can be set
    - affects farm-type and mine-type industries
    - port-type industries are also affected, with requirements at 10x the parameter value
- explicitly set the order of economies in parameter menu and docs (progression is from basic to more complex)
- updated online docs with images for new and changed industries
- docs now include charts showing cargo flow
- docs had some broken html
- updated translations page of docs, linking to newgrf translator
- updated readme.txt with newer vehicle sets


*Translations*

- multiple languages updated

*Codechanges*

- converted significant number of legacy C-Pre-Processor templates to python templates
- removed a large number of redundant industry templates, code is now much easier to maintain
- reduced compile time substantially (from > 2 mins to < 1 min on the test machine)
- support for single-industry compiles using make argument 'TEST_INDUSTRY=clay_pit' (swap 'clay_pit' to the required industry id)
    - single-industry compiles take around 5s on the test machine
- take advantage of increased industry limit in OpenTTD and stop trying to stuff > 64 industries into 64 slots
- grfid bumped, v2 is different enough to v1 to justify a new grfid

0.2 Release
-----------

*Important*

The grfID has changed in FIRS 0.2.  It is *not* savegame compatible with any previous release of FIRS.

*What's new in 0.2?*

Over 230 changes since FIRS 0.1.2

*New Industries*

- Lumber Yard: produces Engineering Supplies from Lumber and Chemicals
- Gas Station: accepts Food, Goods, Fuel Oil.  Locates in town only.  Graphics are temporary and will be replaced.

Clustering for primary industries (farms, mines, forests, plantations).  These industries will locate in clusters when constructed by the game during map generation or randomly during gameplay.  Players may build these industries anywhere during gameplay or in scenario editor.  The number of clusters is adjusted to suit the map size.  Thanks Planetmaker, Yexo and Frosch for making this feature possible.*

Anti-clustering for most secondary industries.  This prevents secondary industries of the same type locating next to each other when constructed by the game during map generation or randomly during gameplay.  Players may build these industries anywhere during gameplay or in scenario editor.*

*Clustering only available in OpenTTD nightly r19902 or newer.  Will fail gracefully in older versions.

*Tweaked numerous production levels*

- Farms now have much lower production.  Use feeder services or one large station to cover multiple farms.
- Oil wells have much higher production.  Oil was not widely available enough on the map.  More industries now use chemicals, so the oil cargo chain is a little more important in gameplay.

*Aluminium Plant production changes*

- now accepts Chemicals.  Chemicals are a small but important cargo for real-life Aluminium production, and this makes for nice gameplay.
- production is now 'combinatory'.  Delivering more than one cargo type within a month will increase output ratios (a good change requested by Terkhen to balance Aluminium Plant better against the Steel Mill).

Seriously improved map colours.  Seriously.

Space out General Stores within a town.  This uses 'prevent conflicting industry types' rather than the FIRS anti-clustering code.  Please report if the effects are weird.

Rework of strings / translation framework to correctly support UTF-8.  Entirely the work of Planetmaker and Terkhen - thanks.

Spanish translation updated (Terkhen)

Reporting of errors in-game is more useful.  Entirely the work of Planetmaker - thanks.

Fruit and Vegetables cargo had the wrong cargo classes defined.  Now fixed.

Changes to industry colours:
- more industries now use industry colours
- some industry colours are now prevented from appearing because they just suck

Completely revised graphics and layouts for:
- Fertiliser Plant
- Aluminium Plant

Snow sprites for several more industries (thanks Irwe!)

Many new / additional layouts for industries including:
- Arable Farm
- Bakery
- Brewery
- Cement Plant
- Dairy
- Furniture Factory
- Glass Works
- Junk Yard
- Machine Shop
- Plastic Plant
- Textile Mill

Improved detail and anti-aliasing of graphics for many industries including:
- Cement Plant
- Furniture Factory
- Machine Shop
- Textile Mill
...and more.
